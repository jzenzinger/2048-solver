You probably know this (probably already historical) popular mobile prank. Your task in this exercise is to try to reproduce it and come up with your own (more or less intelligent) strategy for solving this game.

You will test how the "artificial intelligence
" you create is doing in terms of win / loss, achieved score in 30 games (basic statistics - best score, worst score, average score, number of wins / number of losses, average achieved value of the maximum cell in the game, etc.) .
).

### Scoring:

* Statistics - **2b.**
